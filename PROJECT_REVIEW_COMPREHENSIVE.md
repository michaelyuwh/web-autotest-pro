## 🔍 Detailed Requirements Gap Analysis

### 1. **Recording Mode - CRITICAL GAPS**

**Requirements:**
> Recording Mode: Capture clicks, inputs, hovers, scrolls, navigation via event listeners and MutationObserver. PiP dashboard shows mouse location, inputs, action previews.

**Current Status:** ❌ **Major gaps**
- ✅ PiP UI framework exists (`PiPManager.tsx`)
- ❌ No DOM event listener implementation

- ❌ Missing Playwright dependency imports
- ❌ Incompatible type definitions

**Impact:** Cannot execute tests

### 4. **Video Recording - NOT INTEGRATED**

**Requirements:**
> MediaRecorder for MP4/GIF with action overlays; PiP shows progress

**Current Status:** 🔄 **Implemented but not integrated**
- ✅ `EnhancedVideoRecorder` class exists in shared package
- ✅ Action overlay system implemented
- ✅ GIF generation with gif.js
- ❌ Not integrated into web app
- ❌ No MediaRecorder API usage in main application
- ❌ No recording controls in UI

**Impact:** Key feature not accessible to users

### 5. **AI Integration - EXCELLENT**

**Requirements:**

## 🚨 Critical Technical Issues

### 1. **Build System Failures**

**Issue:** Web app fails to compile with 61 TypeScript errors
```bash
Found 61 errors in 3 files.
Errors  Files
     4  src/components/TestExecution.tsx:35
    52  src/services/playwrightExecutor.ts:62
     5  src/services/testExecutionService.ts:21
```

**Root Causes:**
- Interface conflicts between `shared` and `web-app` packages
- Missing Playwright type imports
- Inconsistent property names (`screenshots` vs `screenshot`)
- Type mismatches in execution engine

**Impact:** **BLOCKING** - Cannot deploy web application

### 2. **Bundle Size Issues**

**Issue:** Browser extension bundles are 5.8MB+ each (recommended limit: 244KB)
```
background.js (5.86 MiB)
content.js (5.87 MiB)
```

**Root Causes:**
- Bundling entire shared package including AI models
- No code splitting for optional features
- Inefficient webpack configuration

**Impact:** Store rejection risk, poor performance

### 3. **Architecture Inconsistencies**

**Issue:** Multiple conflicting type definitions across packages
- `shared/src/types.ts` defines `TestAction` interface
- `web-app/src/services/playwrightExecutorMock.ts` redefines `TestAction`
- Extension has its own type definitions

**Impact:** Maintenance nightmare, compilation failures
