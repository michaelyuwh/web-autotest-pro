# Icon Assets

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)  
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, create simple placeholder icons or use the following CSS-generated icons:

## Creating Icons
You can create simple icons using any image editor or online tools like:
- Canva
- GIMP
- Online icon generators

The icons should represent automated testing, perhaps combining:
- A robot/automation symbol
- A browser window
- Testing checkmarks
- The "AT" logo from the extension

## Temporary Solution
Until proper icons are created, the extension will work with the default browser extension icon.
