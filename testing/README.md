# Testing Suite Configuration

## Overview
This directory contains the comprehensive testing infrastructure for the Web AutoTest Pro platform, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance monitoring.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Framework**: Jest (JavaScript/TypeScript), PyTest (Python)
- **Coverage**: Individual functions, components, and modules
- **Location**: `testing/unit/`
- **Run Command**: `npm run test:unit`

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Framework**: Selenium WebDriver with PyTest
- **Coverage**: Component interactions, API integrations
- **Location**: `testing/integration/`
- **Run Command**: `cd testing && python -m pytest tests/integration/`

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Coverage**: Complete user workflows
- **Location**: `testing/e2e/`
- **Run Command**: `npx playwright test`

### 4. Performance Tests
- **Tools**: Lighthouse, K6, Core Web Vitals monitoring
- **Coverage**: Load testing, performance regression detection
- **Location**: `testing/performance/`

### 5. Security Tests
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Snyk, Trivy
- **Coverage**: Vulnerability scanning, security regression testing
- **Location**: `testing/security/`

## Test Data Management
- Test data is stored in `testing/fixtures/`
- Environment-specific configurations in `testing/config/`
- Mock data generators in `testing/utils/mock-data.js`

## CI/CD Integration
All tests are integrated into GitHub Actions workflows:
- Unit tests run on every push
- Integration tests run on PR creation
- E2E tests run before deployment
- Performance tests run post-deployment
- Security scans run on schedule and releases

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Python dependencies
cd testing
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Playwright browsers
npx playwright install
```

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
# All tests
npm run test

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Security tests
npm run test:security
```

### Test Configuration
- Jest configuration: `jest.config.js`
- Playwright configuration: `playwright.config.ts`
- PyTest configuration: `testing/pytest.ini`
- Lighthouse configuration: `testing/performance/lighthouse/lighthouserc.js`

## Reporting
- Test results are uploaded to GitHub Actions artifacts
- Coverage reports are sent to Codecov
- Performance metrics are tracked over time
- Security scan results trigger alerts

## Best Practices
1. Write tests before implementation (TDD)
2. Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
3. Use descriptive test names
4. Keep tests independent and isolated
5. Mock external dependencies
6. Use page object pattern for E2E tests
7. Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
8. Monitor test execution times
9. Regular security and performance audits
10. Maintain test data and fixtures
